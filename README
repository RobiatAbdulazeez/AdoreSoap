"For my project, I was tasked with conducting research on the product SOAP. This involved analyzing competitors' websites, studying the product attributes, and understanding its properties. To initiate this process,
I meticulously examined various soap websites, extracting valuable insights for my application. Once I gathered this essential information, I proceeded to define the desired properties and attributes for my soap application.

Additionally, I carefully chose the brand name 'Adore Soap,' serving as the foundation for my application. I developed the application using ASP.NET Core version 3.1, despite its outdated status, and employed Microsoft Visual Studio
Code (2019) as my primary development tool. To ensure the security of my work and enable seamless collaboration, I integrated my GitHub Account with the project, allowing for efficient version control and future reference."
Starting off, I built a controller to manage database interactions and then moved on to create user-friendly views. I designed a product catalog page and an 'About Us' section, adding visuals and detailed information for a better user experience.

Next, I introduced models to organize the project structure. After that, I structured the application using scaffolding and added initial data (seed data) defining product properties and attributes. This step aimed to provide users with a clear
understanding of the available products.

For user input, I implemented validation rules, ensuring data accuracy. I also focused on the visual aspects, customizing fonts, and enhancing the overall layout with CSS styles. These efforts were aimed at creating a seamless and visually appealing interface.

Every step was taken with the goal of making the application both functional and user-friendly, ensuring a smooth experience for anyone interacting with it
