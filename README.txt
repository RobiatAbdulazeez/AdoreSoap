# AdoreSoap
"For my project, I was tasked with conducting research on the product SOAP. This involved analyzing competitors' websites, studying the product attributes, and understanding its properties. To initiate this process,
I meticulously examined various soap websites, extracting valuable insights for my application. Once I gathered this essential information, I proceeded to define the desired properties and attributes for my soap application.
Additionally, I carefully chose the brand name 'Adore Soap,' serving as the foundation for my application. I developed the application using ASP.NET Core version 3.1, despite its outdated status, and employed Microsoft Visual Studio Code (2019)
as my primary development tool. To ensure the security of my work and enable seamless collaboration, I integrated my GitHub Account with the project, allowing for efficient version control and future reference."
